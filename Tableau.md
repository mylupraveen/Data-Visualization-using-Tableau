# Data Visualization: Titanic Data Exploration


## Summary

This project deals with exploring Titanic data by visualizing through tableau software. I have made multiple plots so that each plot shows the number of travelling/survived passengers based on sex-factor, age, siblings or spouse and Pclass. Finally we can conclude that most of the female passengers survived when compared to male passengers. 


## Design

I have created 7 different plots where each distinguishing with variables.
I have used most of bar plots to find the exact number of passengers survived/dead and travelling based on their Age, Sex-factor, Sib Sp, port of embarkation etc. I have changed bar plot to lines(continous) for the passengers survived/dead travelling with Sib Sp, which clearly depicts the percentage of passengers survived/dead along with their Sib Sp. Also i have changed barplot to pie charts for the passengers survived/dead rate based on their age groups, where pie charts helps to clearly show the amount of passengers survived and dead for each group of ages.



#### Exploration:

a) Total number of count on Age, Fare, No. of records, Parch, Sib Sp, Survived as per Sex.

b) Total number of passengers travelling/Survived based on Sex/Pclass.

c) Percentage of passengers Survived/dead based on Sex.

d) Percentage of passengers Survived/dead based on Sib Sp.

e) Number of passengers survived/dead through each port of embarkation.

f) Total number of passengers survived/dead based on Age groups.

g) Total number of passengers survived/dead based on Age groups for each Sex factor.

#### Findings from exploration:

a) Female:
   
   Age = 63, Fare = 156, No.of records = 1, parch = 7, Sib Sp = 2, Survived = 2
   
   Male:
   
   Age = 82, Fare = 193, No.of records = 1, parch = 6, Sib Sp = 7, Survived = 2
   

b) Total number of passengers travelling = 891 
   
   Total number of male passengers travelling = 577
   
   Pclass 1 = 122
   
   Pclass 2 = 108
   
   Pclass 3 = 347
   
   Total number of female passengers travelling = 314
   
   Pclass 1 = 94
   
   Pclass 2 = 76
   
   Pclass 3 = 144
   
   Total number of passengers survived = 342
   
   Total number of male passengers survived = 109
   
   Pclass 1 = 45
   
   Pclass 2 = 17
   
   Pclass 3 = 47
   
   Total number of female passengers survived = 233
   
   Pclass 1 = 91
   
   Pclass 2 = 70
   
   Pclass 3 = 72
   
   I conclude that most of the passengers travelling are males, but most of the passengers survived are females. 
    

c) Percentage of male passengers survived = 31.87%
   
   Percentage of female passengers survived = 68.13%
   
   Percentage of male passengers dead = 85.25%
   
   Percentage of female passengers dead = 14.75%
   
   I conclude that msot of male passengers are dead.
   

d) Survived = 1
   
   dead = 0
   
   Percentage of passengers travelling alone:
   
   Survived = 34.54%
   
   dead = 65.46%
   
   Percentage of passengers travelling with one Sib Sp:
   
   Survived = 53.59%
   
   dead = 46.41%
   
   Percentage of passengers travelling with two Sib Sp:
   
   Survived = 46.43%
   
   dead = 53.57%
   
   Percentage of passengers travelling with three Sib Sp:
   
   Survived = 25%
   
   dead = 75%
   
   Percentage of passengers travelling with four Sib Sp:
   
   Survived = 16.67%
   
   dead = 83.33%
   
   Percentage of passengers travelling with five Sib Sp:
   
   Survived = 0%
   
   dead = 100%
   
   Percentage of passengers travelling with eight Sib Sp:
   
   Survived = 0%
   
   dead = 100%
   
   I conclude that None of the passengers travelling with five and eight siblings or spouse are survived and none of 
   the passengers are travelling with six and seven siblings or spouse.
   
   
e) Port of Embarkation
   
   C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton
   
   Passengers survived:
   
   Port C = 93
   
   port Q = 30
   
   port S = 217
   
   Null = 2
   
   
   Passengers dead:
   
   Port C = 75
   
   port Q = 47
   
   port S = 427
    
   I conclude that most of the passengers survived and dead embarked through port S. 
   

f) Age group = Survived passengers/dead passengers
   
   1-10  = 38/26  
   
   11-20 = 44/71
   
   21-30 = 84/146
   
   31-40 = 69/86
   
   41-50 = 33/53
   
   51-60 = 17/25
   
   61-70 = 4/13
   
   71-80 = 1/4
   
   Null  = 52/125
   
   I conclude that maximun number of passengers travelling are between 21-30 Age group and also maximum number of    
   passengers survived and dead are also between 21-30 Age group.
   Null based on passengers who does'nt provide their ages.
   
   
g) Males
   
   Age group = Survived passengers/dead passengers
   
   1-10  = 19/14  
   
   11-20 = 10/59
   
   21-30 = 23/126
   
   31-40 = 23/77
   
   41-50 = 12/43
   
   51-60 = 4/24
   
   61-70 = 1/13
   
   71-80 = 1/4
   
   Null  = 16/108
   
   I conclude that maximum number of male passengers survived and dead are between 21-30 Age group.
   124 male passengers did'nt inform their ages. 
   
   Females
   
   Age group = Survived passengers/dead passengers
   
   1-10  = 19/12  
   
   11-20 = 34/12
   
   21-30 = 61/20
   
   31-40 = 46/9
   
   41-50 = 21/10
   
   51-60 = 13/1
   
   61-70 = 3/1
   
   Null  = 36/17
   
   I conclude that maximum number of female passengers survived and dead are between 21-30 Age group.
   53 female passengers did'nt inform their ages.
